<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tungsten CMP Slurries for Metal Removal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Selection Ratio</li><li>Low Selection Ratio</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tungsten CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) slurries for metal removal are categorized into high selection ratio and low selection ratio markets based on their performance in selective material removal. High selection ratio slurries enable precise control over the polishing process, effectively targeting tungsten while minimizing the removal of other materials. Conversely, low selection ratio slurries are less discriminative, removing multiple materials simultaneously, which can be beneficial in certain applications but may lead to less controlled finishes. Both types cater to diverse industry needs.</p></p>
