<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Resin Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching</li><li>Selective-etching</li><li>Total-etching</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The composite resin bonding agents market is categorized into three main types: self-etching, selective-etching, and total-etching. Self-etching agents combine etching and priming in one step, simplifying application and minimizing sensitivity. Selective-etching involves etching enamel only while treating dentin with a bonding agent, optimizing adhesion. Total-etching uses a comprehensive approach, etching both enamel and dentin before applying bonding agents, providing superior bonding strength but requiring more steps. These variations cater to different clinical needs and preferences in dental procedures.</p></p>
